Hiring Team

Subject: {JOB_TITLE}

Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the {JOB_TITLE} role at {COMPANY}. I bring 15+ years of hands-on engineering experience building enterprise software with C#/.NET, SQL Server, and TypeScript-based front ends (Angular/React), including work in complex, high-stakes product environments.

My background aligns strongly with your core needs: distributed systems design, asynchronous processing, resilient service communication, API-first development, and performance-focused optimization. I have owned projects end-to-end, from architecture and implementation through deployment and production support, while keeping code quality high through automated testing, disciplined reviews, and continuous refactoring.

I also actively use AI coding tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Codex) to accelerate delivery for debugging, test generation, and refactoring while maintaining production-grade standards. This combines speed with engineering rigor, which is essential for modern software teams.

Relevant portfolio work includes:

- Quote Engine Reference Architecture: https://github.com/fchchen/quote-engine-reference-architecture
- TeamForge Reference Architecture: https://github.com/fchchen/teamforge-reference-architecture
- AWS Public Safety Lab (Terraform + distributed messaging patterns): https://github.com/fchchen/aws-dotnet-angular-public-safety-lab
- Azure AI Code Agent: https://github.com/fchchen/azure-ai-code-agent

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Feng Chen
